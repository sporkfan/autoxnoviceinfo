Novice School INFO, VIDEOS and TIPS

Hello Novices,

Novice School is next weekend. Take some time this weekend to make sure your car is ready for the event. Check for leaks, tighten your lug nuts, and make sure your tires aren’t showing cords and your air pressure is right. Get any loose, unnecessary items out of the car.

It’s really important to us that drivers new to the club come away from our events confident that they can autocross. Here’s are 3 videos that discuss important skills for attacking the course…

Here are a few tips that can benefit beginners...

1.	Plan your 1st run based on where you need to be accelerating or decelerating. Your goal is ALWAYS to get on the gas as early as possible. Between elements, you should accelerate as fast as the car and course allow. Slow down before, then accelerate as early as possible on the exit of, each element. 

2.	Decelerate in a straight line. The brakes are the most powerful tool on your car. Using them while trying to turn hard doesn't work. In autocross you are often turning hard. Finding your braking zones will help you find speed.

3.	There’s no difference in cars. They all work basically the same, regardless of specs. Good technique will make you faster in any car on any track. Stick to the basics, even after you've done this for 10 years.

Here’s a video of the world’s quintessential autocross machine: A 1.6L Red Mazda MX5. The fastest pass was 4th fastest overall in a field full of good drivers and a few National Champions. For a car with about 100hp, that's not too shabby. Its 89-inch wheelbase and narrow track allow it to glide between the cones and carry tons of speed at the apex of turns.

Here's a run in a Honda Civic at the NC State Championship in 2017. It's an H Street car, technically the “slowest” class. But, 200hp in a narrow-body car can go pretty fast if you’re smooth and drive a precise line.

4.	The bigger the arcs you can make and still stay inside the course will make you faster. This requires staying close to the cones at all times, and trying to seamlessly connect a series of arcs to navigate the course. If you can drive a precise line, the speed will come. Driving off the line makes you slower because there’s always built-up rubber and dirt, and because you'll have to drive a tighter arc to get back on the line for the next element. It's always better to get into a corner smoothly with balance and accelerate earlier than to overdrive. Watch Andrew Pallotta navigate the first turnaround without shifting (IT'S TIGHT!).  He's as fast as they come and is a multi-time National Champion.

5.	This is an active outdoor sport, be prepared to deal with the elements and heat. Wear a hat, use sunscreen, and avoid getting burned and dehydrated. Don’t be afraid to speak up if you feel ill behind the wheel or while working the course. 

6.	Autocross courses are all similar, but never the same. These videos will give you an idea of what courses look like at speed, and how to attack the various elements. 

7.	Good communication is key to getting instruction. Make sure to tell your instructors what your goals are coming into autocrossing. Every event you attend offers the opportunity to learn. Ask questions, ride with experienced drivers and socialize with members from all the local clubs. And, most importantly, HAVE FUN!
